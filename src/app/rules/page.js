            We want everyone to enjoy their time on The Great Beyond. We don't wish to squash creativity or fun. Beyond the walls of the spawn, the Great Beyond
            is for you to explore and build within. However, we do ask that everyone who joins abides by the following:

              Please do not grief other people's claims or builds. That means don't destroy or put blocks around a claim or build to intentionally make access,
              viewing or expansion difficult.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4 ml-8 text-base md:text-2xl text-white">Please do not use language that would offend within the chat.</li>

              Please do not claim more claim blocks than you need, please do not surround other people's claims with your own (griefing). Please do not place
              your claim directly next to someone else's without some form of discussion/agreement with that person.

              We try our level best to not remove or ban anything from our modpacks, but each of our servers has a list of banned items (if necessary). You can
              view the updated list for each server here:{" "}

              No links to other MC servers running the same pack; because that typically means you aren't here to play on TGB, but just promote your own server.
